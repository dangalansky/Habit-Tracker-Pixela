# Using My Code:

*You'll have to 'comment-out' or 'uncomment' lines of code as you wish, to use each feature.

1) Choose a unique username and type this as a string into the USERNAME parameter
2) Choose a random token and type this as a string into the TOKEN parameter
3) 'Uncomment' and run code under 'create a new user'
4) Choose a graph ID and type this as a string without spaces into the graph_id parameter
5) Within the 'graph_config' dictionary, title your graph, choose a unit of measure (default is minutes), choose type (int or float), and color (all Japanese names so refer to doc for options, purple is default)
6) 'Uncomment' and run code under 'create a new graph'
7) To post a value/pixel, enter number as int or float into 'value_config dictionary
8) 'Uncomment' and run code under 'post value to graph'
9) To update a specific pixel/value, type replacement value as int or float into 'upate_config' dictionary
10) 'Uncomment' code under 'update a specific pixel', change <yyyyMMdd> to date of pixel you wish to update and run code
11) To delete a pixel, graph or user, uncomment that line of code and run it.
